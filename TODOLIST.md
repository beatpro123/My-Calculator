# My-Calculator
#    list of things to add:
#        1. rational problem solver (mostly done)
#            ex: (x-2) / (x-2)(x+4) HA: y = 0, VA: x = -4. hole: (2,1/2)
#        2. factoring 
#            ex: (x+1)(x-3) = x^2-2x-3 (can be expandable)
#        3. create a program to calculate and draw FBD's (I want this to be the best designed function)
#            a) Arrows DONE
#               Draws arrow and labels them based on the type of force (also scale maginitude bassed on #N)
#                   can do this by making gravity half the canvis and divide mag by that number 
#               Make it show the value and type of the vector. 
#            b) UI for FBD's 
#               make it so that you can just add and take away vectors in real time and it changes        
#               acceleration in real time 
#            c) Math for the FBD's 
#                calculates the acceleration of the object if needed
#                calculates the force on a certen vector 
#                maybe calculate forces between 2 objects
#                things to solve for ex:
#                   (1) find the acceleration of the object 
#            d) drawing the FBD's 
#                   convert magnitude of force to distance with a propper and comprehensive scale
#                   lable the vectors
#                   show the incline plane angles 
#        4. draw the projectile motion path and lable the key points                       
#               
#
#        5. make find the roots of a polynomial show if imaginary roots
