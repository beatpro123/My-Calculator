Goals of calculator:
 1. have it do the hard part of my homework.
 2. distract me from actualy listing to the teacher.
 3. allow me to get better at coding.
list of things to add:
    1. rational problem solver (mostly done)
        ex: (x-2) / (x-2)(x+4) HA: y = 0, VA: x = -4. hole: (2,1/2)
    2. factoring 
        ex: (x+1)(x-3) = x^2-2x-3 (can be expandable)
    3. create a program to calculate and draw FBD's (I want this to be the best designed function)
        a) arrows (needs fixing arrowheads are always different size)
            draws arrow and labels them based on the type of force (also change maginitude bassed on #N)
        b) UI for FBD's 
            should be easy (ask for weight of object and all the different forces)
        c) Math for the FBD's 
            calculates the acceleration of the object if needed
            calculates the force on a certen vector 
            maybe calculate forces between 2 objects
    4. maybe move to calculator
